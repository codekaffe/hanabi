  `Ah yes, __**Final Fantasy 14**__! A world known MMO. Known for the beautiful graphics, interchangeable classes, and storyline.
  I can't blame you for enjoying the game. It's beautiful and the community is wonderful.`,
  `From Nekos __(Miqo'te)__, to Dragons __(Au Ra)__, to little potatoes __(Lalefell)__, to the glorious Bunny Girls__(Viera)__...
  So much is offered in this game. There's __Hyur__ which is basically human, __Hrothgar__ which are the BEASTS of the land.
  You're short irl? Easy, just play as a __Roegadyn__, they stand at a whopping 7+ feet tall!!
  __Elezen__ are right up there as well, with their gracious movements and lean builds.`,
  `Everyone loves final fantasy 14, you can't go wrong with it. But man oh man... ~~Don't let me get started on Thancred~~...`,
  `Did you know that Endwalker (the **end/beginning** of a new storyline) is coming out on November 23rd, 2021?
  They will be offering two new classes!! Reaper which is a melee dps, and Sage a healer with nouliths. They both look extremely interesting. 
  Endwalker will also bump the level cap to 90, which will be very interesting to see. Endwalker is also giving us a new zone as well! 
  We are going to have SO much fun, yeah? **(„Å•Ôø£ 3Ôø£)„Å•**`,
